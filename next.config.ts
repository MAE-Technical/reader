    // account) feel like it never got faster no matter how many times you'd
    // already visited this session. 30s (Next 14's own old default) means a
    // revisit within that window is served straight from the client cache —
    // instant, no network round trip — while still refetching soon enough
    // that nothing goes meaningfully stale for a reader bouncing between
    // tabs. Static routes already default to 300s; left as-is.
