// scoped specifically to this segment while that data resolved, and fell
// back on whatever Suspense boundary it found instead. Giving this segment
// its own explicit one is the standard fix: Loader's own default (fixed,
// translucent, full viewport) reads as a page-wide transition into the
// reader rather than disturbing anything already on screen underneath it.
