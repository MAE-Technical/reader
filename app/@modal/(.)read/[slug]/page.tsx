/** Same server-side load as app/read/[slug]/page.tsx, deliberately
 * duplicated rather than shared — this is the one other place a book gets
 * loaded for the reader, and the two pages diverge in what they render
 * around it (ReaderModal vs. Reader directly), so a shared helper would buy
 * little. Intercepts any client-side navigation to /read/[slug] that
 * originates from elsewhere under the root layout (the home community
 * feed today), rendering it as an overlay via the @modal parallel slot
 * instead of replacing the current page — a hard refresh or a direct link
 * still resolves to the real app/read/[slug]/page.tsx, since interception
 * only applies to client-side <Link>/router navigation. */
