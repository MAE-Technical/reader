 * One style for every screen size (Tailwind handles the one place sizing
 * actually needs to flex — see `sm:` below — rather than a hand-maintained
 * `isMobile` branch): bottom-right, the same corner every other floating
 * reader control already treats as the thumb-reachable "utility" spot.
 *
 * The count sits *inside* the button rather than as a badge sticker
 * overlapping the icon's corner — icon and number side by side in one
 * small pill, tight together (2px gap) so it reads as one compact figure
 * rather than two things sharing a shape. Hairline `--reader-border` ring,
 * no shadow. Collapses to a plain circle when there's nothing to count yet
 * (no dangling empty pill). `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` keeps it clear of
 * the home indicator on notched phones — a no-op everywhere else.
