/**
 * The community-notes tab's layout — two independent flex-col stacks
 * (left/right) in row-major reading order (card 1 left, card 2 right, card
 * 3 left, ...), not a CSS grid.
 *
 * A grid was the first version, and broke visibly once a book had more than
 * a couple of notes: a grid's rows are *shared* tracks — even with
 * `items-start` (which only stops the *shorter* cell in a row from
 * stretching to fill it), the row's own height is still set by its tallest
 * cell. A note card's height depends entirely on how much a reader wrote
 * and how long its reply thread is, so neighboring cells in the same row
 * routinely differ wildly — and the shorter column ends up with a
 * mismatched, content-dependent gap under each such card instead of a
 * uniform one. Two self-contained flex-col stacks remove the row coupling
 * entirely — each column's own gap is always exactly gap-5.
 *
 * Not CSS multi-column masonry (`columns-2`) either: masonry fills the
 * *entire first column* before spilling into the second, which for a
 * handful of unevenly-sized cards crams nearly everything into one column
 * and leaves the other almost empty. Alternating by index instead always
 * keeps cards in reading order across the row — for an odd card count, the
 * leftover lands in the left column, the same position every other row's
 * first card already has.
 *
 * Rendered as two full DOM trees, one hidden per breakpoint, rather than
 * one structure reflowed by CSS — the same swap AppBottomNav/AppSidebar
 * already do for the app shell itself. The single mobile column
 * (0,1,2,3,...) and the two desktop columns (evens down the left, odds
 * down the right) are genuinely different shapes; no CSS variant can
 * retarget that on its own.
