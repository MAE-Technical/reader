/**
 * `/@{pseudonym}` — a reader's own profile, root-level and Twitter/GitHub-
 * style rather than nested under its own `/reader` segment (CurrentReaders.tsx's
 * roster links here). A single dynamic segment at the app root necessarily
 * shadows any *literal* top-level path this app hasn't already claimed with
 * its own page.tsx (e.g. a bare `/admin`, which has none today — only
 * `/admin/audio` and `/admin/books` do) — every real route stays safe,
 * since Next.js always prefers a matching static segment over this dynamic
 * one at the same level; only an otherwise-unmatched single segment ever
 * reaches here.
 *
 * `decodeURIComponent` here is load-bearing, not defensive styling:
 * `generateMetadata`'s own `params` hands back a plain "@yeast", but this
 * page's own async component receives the *same* route's params re-encoded
 * as "%40yeast" over the RSC wire — confirmed by direct inspection, not
 * assumed; presumably Next's flight serializer escaping "@" to dodge its
 * own protocol's reserved-prefix syntax. Decoding first makes both shapes
 * converge (decoding an already-decoded "@yeast" is a harmless no-op, no
 * "%" sequence in it to touch) rather than special-casing which form this
 * particular Next version happens to hand back. Falls back to the raw
 * value on a malformed escape (a hand-typed `/@%zz`, say) rather than
 * 500ing — that just fails the "@"-prefix check below and 404s normally.
