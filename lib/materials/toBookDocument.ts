 * level, audio, children) stays exactly as real/complete as before this
 * existed. That's deliberate: `passages.length`/`passage.type` are load-
 * bearing signals elsewhere (ChaptersDrawer's "does this chapter have
 * content" check, the endnotes-index heuristic, reading-progress's
 * passage-count math, resume/audio passage-index lookups) — stripping the
 * *array* itself would have made an unloaded chapter look structurally
 * different (and in ChaptersDrawer's case, wrongly non-clickable) rather
 * than just visually blank for a moment. Only `text` (by far the dominant
 * byte weight of a book's JSON) is what actually needed deferring; nothing
 * downstream reads it before the reader can actually see it.
 *
 * Image passages are left untouched — their `text` is alt copy, already
 * small, and `src` (the thing that actually renders) was never in scope
 * here anyway. */

/**
 * What `/read/[slug]` and its modal counterpart actually load — every
 * section's real structure (spine order, ids, audio tracks, passage counts/
 * types) up front, but only *one* section's actual prose text eagerly: the
 * one the reader is either deep-linking straight into (`eagerSectionId`,
 * from `?section=`) or, absent that, the book's very first spine entry —
 * this function has no way to know a returning reader's real saved resume
 * position itself (that lives client-side, in reading-position-store's
 * localStorage, or behind a Bearer token this server call never sees), so
 * that's `useProgressiveText`'s job once mounted: resolve the real target,
 * and if it isn't the one section already eagerly included here, fetch
 * just that one before the reader can start reading, then fetch everything
 * else in the background. `eagerSectionIds` tells the client exactly which
 * section(s) it can trust as already-real, so it never re-fetches
 * needlessly or (worse) mistakes "not yet loaded" for "genuinely has no
 * content."
 *
 * Rather than bypass the materials table the way the old direct
 * `getBookDocument()` Storage read did, this resolves the row and calls
 * straight into the same `projectMaterial` the public
 * `GET /api/materials/{materialId}` route itself calls — no HTTP round
 * trip to this app's own API (same pattern as `listPublishedMaterials`) —
 * using `fullContent: true` to get the real `Section[]` tree instead of the
 * pruned DB-only TocSection[] outline. A slug that doesn't resolve to a
 * *published* materials row throws the same as the old `BookNotFoundError`
 * did — this is a real behavior improvement over the old direct Storage
 * read, which had no notion of "published" at all.
