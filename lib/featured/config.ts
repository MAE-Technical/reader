 * getSurveyBooks(): the JSON config only ever stores `materials.id` UUIDs
 * (plus the hand-written curatorial line for each), so title/author/cover
 * always come live from the DB and this can never drift from what's
 * actually published. Config order is preserved (it's the curation, not
 * whatever order the DB happens to return); an id the config lists that
 * isn't a published material (typo, unpublished, deleted) is silently
 * dropped rather than rendering a broken card.
